# Overview
This project documents my attempt at reverse engineering the serial protocol for the GE Profile Harmony washer and dryer. 

# Background
The GE Profile Harmony washer and dryer are touch-screen interface washers from 2003 that featured a communication link between the washer and dryer. I want to tap into this communications link to be able to add my own notification system for when washer and dryer loads were done.
